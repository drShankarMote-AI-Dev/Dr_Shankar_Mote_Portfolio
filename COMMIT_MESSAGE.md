## Documentation and Accessibility Improvements

This commit enhances the codebase with:

- Added CHANGELOG.md documenting all CSS variables, breakpoints, and modified files
- Added detailed comments in CSS files for future contributors:
  - Responsive breakpoints are fully documented in responsive.css
  - Typography scales and variables explained in typography.css
  - Accessibility features highlighted in focus-styles.css
  - Variable system documented in utilities.css
- Added semantic comments in HTML for better code organization
- Added aria-hidden="true" to decorative emojis for screen reader compatibility

These changes make the codebase more maintainable, improve accessibility for users with disabilities, and provide clear documentation for future contributors.
